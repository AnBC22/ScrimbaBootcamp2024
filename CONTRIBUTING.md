# Welcome, Bootcamp Students!

## Why Contribute to This Project?

This project exists for the purpose of bootcamp students having the chance to practice the workflow of open-source projects and working on a team in general. By working on this collaborative project with other students who - like you - are learning, you can build confidence as your understanding of team workflow grows. The goal is to learn how to fork a project, clone it to your machine, make changes locally, and submit a pull request to the main repository. The stakes are low - there is no due date, and you can work on this as much or as little as you want. 

## What Languages Do I Need to Know to Contribute?

This project will use HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript and Markdown. The hope is that _all_ student - whether they are just starting to learn how to code or have been doing it for a while - will feel like they are able to make a contribution.

## How to Contribute

### Find an Issue

1. Look through the existing [issues](https://github.com/ScrimbaBootcamp/ScrimbaBootcamp2024/issues) to see if there is an issue that hasn't been assigned and that you would like to take on. If there isn't an issue for something you would like to work on, you can create a new one!

2. Ask to be assigned to an issue, and tag the maintainer (Micha). Pull requests without a corresponding issue may or may not be accepted.

3. Please work on one issue at a time in order to avoid miscommunication. If you find there is something else you would like to change while working on your issue, please follow the previous two steps to create an Issue and - if you would like to work on it - ask to be assigned.

4. If you see code that was written by another contributor that you feel could be improved, you might wish to tag them in the issue that you create so that you can discuss potential changes and decide who will work on this issue. One or both of you may then request assignment to the issue.

### Workflow

Here is a short video that will demonstrate the process of forking, cloning, adding an upstream remote repository, creating a feature branch, and submitting a pull request. :sweat_smile: (It does get cut off at the very end! GitHub will tell you if your changes are able to be merged, pending a reviewers approval. I think you just have to confirm that you want to submit the pull request by pressing one more button on that page.)
